## MVPs:

1. Home page should have a search bar where users can search for videos by hitting the YouTube API that returns a list of related video

2. On click of a video that is returned from the search query, it changes to the following view:

   a. Search bar
  
   b. Embedded Youtube video
  
   c. Video information (title, view count)
  
   d. List of related videos
